# NativeScriptTesting
Getting NativeScript set up for non-production usage.

[Click here](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup) for the NativeScript installation guide.

After getting NativeScript setup, run a quick `npm install` to get up and running!

If you have a phone handy, you can use `tns run android`. If you don't, just add a `--emulator` tag at the end to use the emulator included with Android SDK.
